# 🚀 AttendXpert - Smart Attendance System

Welcome to **AttendXpert**, a **microservices-based Smart Attendance System** that efficiently manages attendance tracking using advanced technologies like **Face Recognition, QR Code Scanning, and Secure Authentication**.

## 🎯 Purpose
**AttendXpert** is designed to automate and simplify attendance management for organizations, educational institutions, and businesses. It ensures **accuracy, security, and efficiency** in handling user data, authentication, and attendance tracking.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- ⚛️ **React.js** - For the frontend UI.
- 🌐 **Node.js & Express.js** - Backend microservices.
- 📦 **MongoDB** - Database for storing user and attendance data.
- 🔐 **JWT Authentication** - For secure user authentication.
- 🤖 **Face Recognition (face-api.js)** - For biometric attendance.
- 📲 **QR Code Scanning** - Alternative method for attendance marking.
- ☁️ **Firebase** - For real-time notifications and storage.
- 🚀 **Docker & Kubernetes** - For containerization and scaling.

## 📂 Microservices Architecture
The system follows a **microservices-based approach** to ensure **scalability and maintainability**. Each microservice operates independently and communicates via APIs.
